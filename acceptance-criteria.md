# Acceptance Criteria (AC)

## Frontend

### Login

- The credentials consist of a username/password form. You should validate the user credentials locally. (admin as username and admin as password, anything different should be considered as incorrect credentials). Shows all the validation that you think makes sense.

- The user should remain logged against a storage instance that fits your preference (Local db, Local storage, cookies), so if the user tries to log in already logged, it should be redirected to the main page, and if it is not logged and it tries to go to the main page it should be redirected to the login page.

### Main page

- The home screen will have a search bar with a list of Pokemon. Youâ€™ll have to use this API for it: [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co). The API is paginated so you should create a solution for it.

- Each Pokemon should be shown with its photo and name.

### Detail view

- If the user clicks on a Pokemon from the list, a modal should be shown with detailed information about the Pokemon (Abilities, moves, and forms).

> - Be prepared to discuss your solution.
